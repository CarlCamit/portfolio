# Design

### Target audience and message

- Future employers
- Show who I am and what I am capable off

### Ideas

- Lack the skills necessary to actually create what was in my head
- Focused on content delivery rather than aesthetics
- Decided to go with a minimalist structure.

### Influence

- [Mood Board](https://au.pinterest.com/carlcamit/portfolio/)

### The content

- Keeping in line with the minimalist structure, I wanted a brief bio, skills, projects, and contact page in a single page.

### Styling

- [Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/ESkJF6rE5yWYMproBFqfQEMt/Portfolio-Wireframe)
